    <h2>||CHAPTER 10||</h2>
    <div class="main-wrapper">
      <div class="main-container">
        <div class="item">1. <br>One destitute of wealth is not destitute, he is indeed rich (if he is learned); but the man devoid of learning is destitute in every way. </div>
        <div class="item">2. <br>We should carefully scrutinise that place upon which we step (having it ascertained to be free from filth and living creatures like insects, etc.); we should drink water which has been filtered (through a clean cloth); we should speak only those words which have the sanction of the satras; and do that act which we have carefully considered. </div>
        <div class="item">3. <br>He who desires sense gratification must give up all thoughts of acquiring knowledge; and he who seeks knowledge must not hope for sense gratification. How can he who seeks sense gratification acquire knowledge, and he who possesses knowledge enjoy mundane sense pleasure? </div>
        <div class="item">4. <br>What is it that escapes the observation of poets? What is that act women are incapable of doing? What will drunken people not prate? What will not a crow eat? </div>
        <div class="item">5. <br>Fate makes a beggar a king and a king a beggar. He makes a rich man poor and a poor man rich. </div>
        <div class="item">6. <br>The beggar is a miser’s enemy; the wise counsellor is the fool’s enemy; her husband is an adulterous wife’s enemy; and the moon is the enemy of the thief. </div>
        <div class="item">7. <br>Those who are destitute of learning, penance, knowledge, good disposition, virtue and benevolence are brutes wandering the earth in the form of men. They are burdensome to the earth. </div>
        <div class="item">8. <br>Those that are empty-minded cannot be benefited by instruction. Bamboo does not acquire the quality of sandalwood by being associated with the Malaya Mountain. </div>
        <div class="item">9. <br>What good can the scriptures do to a man who has no sense of his own? Of what use is as mirror to a blind man? </div>
        <div class="item">10. <br>Nothing can reform a bad man, just as the posterious cannot become a superior part of the body though washed one hundred times. </div>
        <div class="item">11. <br>By offending a kinsman, life is lost; by offending others, wealth is lost; by offending the king, everything is lost; and by offending a brahmana one’s whole family is ruined. </div>
        <div class="item">12. <br>It is better to live under a tree in a jungle inhabited by tigers and elephants, to maintain oneself in such a place with ripe fruits and spring water, to lie down on grass and to wear the ragged barks of trees than to live amongst one’s relations when reduced to poverty. </div>
        <div class="item">13. <br>The brahmana is like tree; his prayers are the roots, his chanting of the Vedas are the branches, and his religious act are the leaves. Consequently effort should be made to preserve his roots for if the roots are destroyed there can be no branches or leaves. </div>
        <div class="item">14. <br> My mother is Kamala devi (Lakshmi), my father is Lord Janardana (Vishnu), my kinsmen are the Vishnu-bhaktas (Vaisnavas) and, my homeland is all the three worlds. </div>
        <div class="item">15. <br>(Through the night) a great many kinds of birds perch(Sit and rest) on a tree but in the morning they fly in all the ten directions. Why should we lament (Expression of sorrow) for that? (Similarly, we should not grieve when we must inevitably part company from our dear ones). </div>
        <div class="item">16. <br>He who possesses intelligence is strong; how can the man that is unintelligent be powerful? The elephant of the forest having lost his senses by intoxication was tricked into a lake by a small rabbit. (this verse refers to a famous story from the niti-sastra called pancatantra compiled by the pandit Vishnusharma 2500 years ago). </div>
        <div class="item">17. <br>Why should I be concerned for my maintenance while absorbed in praising the glories of Lord Vishwambhara (Vishnu), the supporter of all. Without the grace of Lord Hari, how could milk flow from a mother’s breast for a child’s nourishment? Repeatedly thinking only in this way, O Lord of the Yadus, O husband of Lakshmi, all my time is spent in serving Your lotus feet. </div>
        <div class="item">18. <br>I am hungary from other language too besides Sanskrit. Similarly as Gods of the heaven thirst for the lips of the heavenly beauties even partaking the nectar. </div>
        <div class="item">19. <br>Flour has ten more nutritional value than the grains. Milk has ten more value then the floor. Meat has eight times more value than the milk. And ghee has ten times more energy value than the meat. </div>
        <div class="item">20. <br>The leafy vegetable breed deaseas. the milk fattens the body. the Ghee builds up semen and the meat adds meat only. </div>
