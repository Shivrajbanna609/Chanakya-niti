    <h2>||CHAPTER 14||</h2>
    <div class="main-wrapper">
      <div class="main-container">
        <div class="item">1. <br>This earth is blessed with only three gems; water, food grains and the words of good wish. but the fools think that the precious stones are gems. </div>
        <div class="item">2. <br>Poverty, disease, sorrow, imprisonment and other evils are the fruits borne by the tree of one’s own sins. </div>
        <div class="item">3. <br>Wealth, a friend, a wife, and a kingdom may be regained; but this body when lost may never be acquired again. </div>
        <div class="item">4. <br>The enemy can be overcome by the union of large numbers, just as grass through its collectiveness wards off erosion caused by heavy rainfall. </div>
        <div class="item">5. <br>Oil on water, a secret communicated to a base man, a gift given to a worthy receiver, and scriptural instruction given to an intelligent man spread out by virtue of their nature. </div>
        <div class="item">6. <br>If men should always retain the state of mind they experience when hearing religious instruction, when present at a crematorium ground, and when in sickness — then who could not attain liberation. </div>
        <div class="item">7. <br>If a man should feel before, as he feels after, repentance — then who would not attain perfection? </div>
        <div class="item">8. <br>We should not feel pride in our charity, austerity, valour, scriptural knowledge, modesty and morality for the world is full of the rarest gems. </div>
        <div class="item">9. <br>He who lives in our mind is near though he may actually be far away; but he who is not in our heart is far though he may really be nearby. </div>
        <div class="item">10. <br>We should always speak what would please the man of whom we expect a favour, like the hunter who sings sweetly when he desires to shoot a deer. </div>
        <div class="item">11. <br>It is runious to be familier with the king, fire, the religious preceptor, and a woman. To be altogether indifferent of them is to be deprived of the opportunity to benifit ourselves, hence our association with them must be from a safe distance.  </div>
        <div class="item">12. <br>We should always deal cautiously with fire, water, women, foolish people, serpents, and members of a royal family; for they may, when the occasion presents itself, at once bring about our death. </div>
        <div class="item">13. <br>He should be considered to be living who is virtuous and pious, but the life of a man who is destitute of religion and virtues is void of any blessing. </div>
        <div class="item">14. <br>If you wish to gain control of the world by the performance of a single deed, then keep the following fifteen, which are prone to wander here and there, from getting the upper hand of you: the five sense objects (objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch); the five sense organs (ears, eyes, nose, tongue and skin) and organs of activity (hands, legs, mouth, genitals and anus). </div>
        <div class="item">15. <br>He is a pandit (man of knowledge) who speaks what is suitable to the occasion, who renders loving service according to his ability, and who knows the limits of his anger. </div>
        <div class="item">16. <br>One single object (a woman) appears in three different ways: to the man who practices austerity it appears as a corpse, to the sensual it appears as a woman, and to the dogs as a lump of flesh. </div>
        <div class="item">17. <br>A wise man should not divulge the formula of a medicine which he has well prepared; an act of charity which he has performed; domestic conflicts; private affairs with his wife; poorly prepared food he may have been offered; or slang he may have heard. </div>
        <div class="item">18. <br>The cuckoos remain silent for a long time (for several seasons) until they are able to sing sweetly (in the Spring ) so as to give joy to all. </div>
        <div class="item">19. <br>We should secure and keep the following: the blessings of meritorious deeds, wealth, grain, the words of the spiritual master, and rare medicines. Otherwise life becomes impossible. </div>
        <div class="item">20. <br>Eschew (Avoid) wicked company and associate with saintly persons. Acquire virtue day and night, and always meditate on that which is eternal forgetting that which is temporary. </div>
