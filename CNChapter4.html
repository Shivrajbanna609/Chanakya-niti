    <h2>||CHAPTER 4||</h2>
    <div class="main-wrapper">
      <div class="main-container">
        <div class="item">1. <br>These five: the life-span, the type of work, wealth, learning and the time of one’s death are determined while one is in the womb. </div>
        <div class="item">2. <br>Offspring, friends and relatives flee from a devotee of the Lord: yet those who follow him bring merit to their families through their devotion. </div>
        <div class="item">3. <br> Fish, tortoises, and birds bring up their young by means of sight, attention and touch; so do saintly men afford protection to their associates by the same means. </div>
        <div class="item">4. <br>As long as your body is healthy and under control and death is distant, try to save your soul; when death is immanent what can you do? </div>
        <div class="item">5. <br>Learning is like a cow of desire. It, like her, yields in all seasons. Like a mother, it feeds you on your journey. Therefore learning is a hidden treasure. </div>
        <div class="item">6. <br>A single son endowed with good qualities is far better than a hundred devoid of them. For the moon, though one, dispels the darkness, which the stars, though numerous, can not. </div>
        <div class="item">7. <br>A still-born son as superior to a foolish son endowed with a long life. The first causes grief for but a moment while the latter like a blazing fire consumes his parents in grief for life. </div>
        <div class="item">8. <br>Residing in a small village devoid of proper living facilities, serving a person born of a low family, unwholesome food, a frowning wife, a foolish son, and a widowed daughter burn the body without fire. </div>
        <div class="item">9. <br>What good is a cow that neither gives milk nor conceives? Similarly, what is the value of the birth of a son if he becomes neither learned nor a pure devotee of the Lord? </div>
        <div class="item">10. <br>When one is consumed by the sorrows of life, three things give him relief: offspring, a wife, and the company of the Lord’s devotees. </div>
        <div class="item">11. <br>Kings speak for once, men of learning once, and the daughter is given in marriage once. All these things happen once and only once. </div>
        <div class="item">12. <br>Religious austerities should be practiced alone, study by two, and singing by three. A journey should be undertaken by four, agriculture by five, and war by many together. </div>
        <div class="item">13. <br>She is a true wife who is clean (suci), expert, chaste, pleasing to the husband, and truthful. </div>
        <div class="item">14. <br>The house of a childless person is a void, all directions are void to one who has no relatives, the heart of a fool is also void, but to a poverty stricken man all is void. </div>
        <div class="item">15. <br>Scriptural lessons not put into practice are poison; a meal is poison to him who suffers from indigestion; a social gathering is poison to a poverty stricken person; and a young wife is poison to an aged man. </div>
        <div class="item">16. <br>That man who is without religion and mercy should be rejected. A guru without spiritual knowledge should be rejected. The wife with an offensive face should be given up, and so should relatives who are without affection. </div>
        <div class="item">17. <br>Constant travel brings old age upon a man; a horse becomes old by being constantly tied up; lack of sexual contact with her husband brings old age upon a woman; and garments become old through being left in the sun. </div>
        <div class="item">18. <br>Consider again and again the following: the right time, the right friends, the right place, the right means of income, the right ways of spending, and from whom you derive your power. </div>
        <div class="item">19. <br>For the twice-born the fire (Agni) is a representative of God. The Supreme Lord resides in the heart of His devotees. Those of average intelligence (alpa-buddhi or kanista-adhikari) see God only in His srimurti, but those of broad vision see the Supreme Lord everywhere. </div>
