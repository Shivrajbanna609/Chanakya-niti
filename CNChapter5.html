    <h2>||CHAPTER 5||</h2>
    <div class="main-wrapper">
      <div class="main-container">
        <div class="item">1. <br>Agni is the worshipable person for the twice-born; the brahmana for the other castes; the husband for the wife; and the guest who comes for food at the midday meal for all. </div>
        <div class="item">2. <br>As gold is tested in four ways by rubbing, cutting, heating and beating – – so a man should be tested by these four things: his renunciation, his conduct, his qualities and his actions. </div>
        <div class="item">3. <br>A thing may be dreaded as long as it has not overtaken you, but once it has come upon you, try to get rid of it without hesitation. </div>
        <div class="item">4. <br>Though persons be born from the same womb and under the same stars, they do not become alike in disposition as the thousand fruits of the badari tree.</div>
        <div class="item">5. <br>He whose hands are clean does not like to hold an office; he who desires nothing cares not for bodily decorations; he who is only partially educated cannot speak agreeably; and he who speaks out plainly cannot be a deceiver. </div>
        <div class="item">6. <br>The learned are envied by the foolish; rich men by the poor; chaste women by adulteresses; and beautiful ladies by ugly ones. </div>
        <div class="item">7. <br>Indolent application ruins study; money is lost when entrusted to others; a farmer who sows his seed sparsely is ruined; and an army is lost for want of a commander. </div>
        <div class="item">8. <br>Learning is retained through putting into practice; family prestige is maintained through good behaviour; a respectable person is recognised by his excellent qualities; and anger is seen in the eyes. </div>
        <div class="item">9. <br>Religion is preserved by wealth; knowledge by diligent practice; a king by conciliatory words; and a home by a dutiful housewife. </div>
        <div class="item">10. <br>Those who blaspheme Vedic wisdom, who ridicule the life style recommended in the satras, and who deride men of peaceful temperament, come to grief unnecessarily. </div>
        <div class="item">11. <br>Charity puts an end to poverty; righteous conduct to misery; discretion to ignorance; and scrutiny to fear. </div>
        <div class="item">12. <br>There is no disease (so destructive) as lust; no enemy like infatuation; no fire like wrath; and no happiness like spiritual knowledge. </div>
        <div class="item">13. <br>A man is born alone and dies alone; and he experiences the good and bad consequences of his karma alone; and he goes alone to hell or the Supreme abode. </div>
        <div class="item">14. <br>Heaven is but a straw to him who knows spiritual life (Krsna consciousness); so is life to a valiant man; a woman to him who has subdued his senses; and the universe to him who is without attachment for the world. </div>
        <div class="item">15. <br>Learning is a friend on the journey; a wife in the house; medicine in sickness; and religious merit is the only friend after death. </div>
        <div class="item">16. <br>Rain which falls upon the sea is useless; so is food for one who is satiated; in vain is a gift for one who is wealthy; and a burning lamp during the daytime is useless. </div>
        <div class="item">17. <br>There is no water like rainwater; no strength like one’s own; no light like that of the eyes; and no wealth more dear than food grain. </div>
        <div class="item">18. <br>The poor wish for wealth; animals for the faculty of speech; men wish for heaven; and godly persons for liberation. </div>
        <div class="item">19. <br>The earth is supported by the power of truth; it is the power of truth that makes the sun shine and the winds blow; indeed all things rest upon truth. </div>
        <div class="item">20. <br>The Goddess of wealth is unsteady (chanchala), and so is the life breath. The duration of life is uncertain, and the place of habitation is uncertain; but in all this inconsistent world religious merit alone is immovable. </div>
        <div class="item">21. <br>Among men the barber is cunning; among birds the crow; among beasts the jackal; and among women, the malin (flower girl). </div>
        <div class="item">22. <br>These five are your fathers; he who gave you birth, girdled you with sacred thread, teaches you, provides you with food, and protects you from fearful situations. </div>
        <div class="item">23. <br>These five should be considered as mothers; the king’s wife, the preceptor’s wife, the friend’s wife, your wife’s mother, and your own mother.</div>
