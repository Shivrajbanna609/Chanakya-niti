    <h2>||CHAPTER 1||</h2>
    <div class="main-wrapper">
      <div class="main-container">
        <div class="item">1. <br> Humbly bowing down before the almighty Lord Sri Vishnu, the Lord of the three worlds, I recite maxims of the science of political ethics (niti) selected from the various satras.</div>
        <div class="item">2. <br> That man who by the study of these maxims from the satras acquires a knowledge of the most celebrated principles of duty, and understands what ought and what ought not to be followed, and what is good and what is bad, is most excellent. </div>
        <div class="item">3. <br> Therefore with an eye to the public good, I shall speak that which, when understood, will lead to an understanding of things in their proper perspective.</div>
        <div class="item">4. <br> Even a pandit comes to grief by giving instruction to a foolish disciple, by maintaining a wicked wife, and by excessive familiarity with the miserable</div>
        <div class="item">5. <br> A wicked wife, a false friend, a saucy servant and living in a house with a serpent in it are nothing but death.</div>
        <div class="item">6. <br> One should save his money against hard times, save his wife at the sacrifice of his riches, but invariably one should save his soul even at the sacrifice of his wife and riches.</div>
        <div class="item">7. <br> Save your wealth against future calamity. Do not say, ‘What what fear has a rich man of calamity?’ When riches begin to forsake one even the accumulated stock dwindles away.</div>
        <div class="item">8. <br> Do not inhabit a country where you are not respected, cannot earn your livelihood, have no friends, or cannot acquire knowledge.</div>
        <div class="item">9. <br> Do not stay for a single day where there are not these five persons: a wealthy man, a brahmana well versed in Vedic lore, a king, a river and a physician.</div>
        <div class="item">10. <br> Wise men should never go into a country where there are no means of earning one’s livelihood, where the people have no dread of anybody, have no sense of shame, no intelligence, or a charitable disposition.</div>
        <div class="item">11. <br> Test a servant while in the discharge of his duty, a relative in difficulty, a friend in adversity, and a wife in misfortune.</div>
        <div class="item">12. <br> He is a true friend who does not forsake us in time of need, misfortune, famine, or war, in a king’s court, or at the crematorium (smasana).</div>
        <div class="item">13. <br> He who gives up what is imperishable for that which perishable, loses that which is imperishable; and doubtlessly loses that which is perishable also.</div>
        <div class="item">14. <br> A wise man should marry a virgin of a respectable family even if she is deformed. He should not marry one of a low-class family, through beauty. Marriage in a family of equal status is preferable.</div>
        <div class="item">15. <br> Do not put your trust in rivers, men who carry weapons, beasts with claws or horns, women, and members of a royal family.</div>
        <div class="item">16. <br> Even from poison extract nectar, wash and take back gold if it has fallen in filth, receive the highest knowledge (Krsna consciousness) from a low born person; so also a girl possessing virtuous qualities (stri-ratna) even if she be born in a disreputable family.</div>
        <div class="item">17. <br> Women have hunger two-fold, shyness four-fold, daring six-fold, and lust eight-fold as compared to men.</div>
