    <h2>||CHAPTER 2||</h2>
    <div class="main-wrapper">
      <div class="main-container">
        <div class="item">1. <br>Untruthfulness, rashness, guile, stupidity, avarice, uncleanliness and cruelty are a women’s seven natural flaws. </div>
        <div class="item">2. <br>To have ability for eating when dishes are ready at hand, to be robust and virile in the company of one’s religiously wedded wife, and to have a mind for making charity when one is prosperous are the fruits of no ordinary austerities. </div>
        <div class="item">3. <br>He whose son is obedient to him, whose wife’s conduct is in accordance with his wishes, and who is content with his riches, has his heaven here on earth. </div>
        <div class="item">4. <br>They alone are sons who are devoted to their father. He is a father who supports his sons. He is a friend in whom we can confide, and she only is a wife in whose company the husband feels contented and peaceful. </div>
        <div class="item">5. <br>Avoid him who talks sweetly before you but tries to ruin you behind your back, for he is like a pitcher of poison with milk on top. </div>
        <div class="item">6. <br>Do not put your trust in a bad companion nor even trust an ordinary friend, for if he should get angry with you, he may bring all your secrets to light. </div>
        <div class="item">7. <br>Do not reveal what you have thought upon doing, but by wise council keep it secret being determined to carry it into execution. </div>
        <div class="item">8. <br>Foolishness is indeed painful, and verily so is youth, but more painful by far than either is being obliged in another person’s house. </div>
        <div class="item">9. <br>There does not exist a ruby in every mountain, nor a pearl in the head of every elephant; neither are the sadhus to be found everywhere, nor sandal trees in every forest. </div>
        <div class="item">10. <br>Wise men should always bring up their sons in various moral ways, for children who have knowledge of niti-sastra and are well-behaved become a glory to their family. </div>
        <div class="item">11. <br>Those parents who do not educate their sons are their enemies; for as is a crane among swans, so are ignorant so are ignorant sons in a public assembly. </div>
        <div class="item">12. <br>Many a bad habit is developed through overindulgence, and many a good one by chastisement, therefore beat your son as well as your pupil; never indulge them. (“Spare the rod and spoil the child.”) </div>
        <div class="item">13. <br>Let not a single day pass without your learning a verse, half a verse, or a fourth of it, or even one letter of it; nor without attending to charity, study and other pious activity. </div>
        <div class="item">14. <br>Separation from the wife, disgrace from one’s own people, an enemy saved in battle, service to a wicked king, poverty, and a mismanaged assembly: these six kinds of evils, if afflicting a person, burn him even without fire. </div>
        <div class="item">15. <br>Trees on a river bank, a woman in another man’s house, and kings without counsellors go without doubt to swift destruction. </div>
        <div class="item">16. <br>A brahmana’s strength is in his learning, a king’s strength is in his army, a vaishya’s strength is in his wealth and a shudra’s strength is in his attitude of service. </div>
        <div class="item">17. <br>The prostitute has to forsake a man who has no money, the subject a king that cannot defend him, the birds in a tree that bears no fruit, and the guests in a house after they have finished their meals. </div>
        <div class="item">18. <br>Brahmanas quit their patrons after receiving alms from them, scholars leave their teachers after receiving education from them, and animals desert a forest that has been burnt down. </div>
        <div class="item">19. <br>He who befriends a man whose conduct is vicious, whose vision impure, and who is notoriously crooked, is rapidly ruined. </div>
        <div class="item">20. <br>Friendship between equals flourishes, service under a king is respectable, it is good to be business-minded in public dealings, and a handsome lady is safe in her own home. </div>
